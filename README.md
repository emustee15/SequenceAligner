# SequenceAligner
A simple sequence aligner made for my bioinformatics class in a small group from Spring 2013. 

This project was created by Eric Mustee, Matt Naso, and Brendan Mikolajczyk during spring 2013.
The project uses sequence alignment algorithms to score how similar two subsequences are to each other.
For more information on sequence alignment, see [Wikipedia].

### Features
- Substitution Matrix Support
- Global and Semi-Global Alignment (using the [Needleman–Wunsch] scoring algorithm)
- Copy a formatted, aligned sequence to clipboard
- Easy to use GUI
- Scoring table output
